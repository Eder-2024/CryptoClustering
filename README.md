# CryptoClustering
# 📊 Crypto Clustering Analysis

This project performs **cryptocurrency market clustering** using machine learning techniques such as **K-Means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. The goal is to analyze, visualize, and compare clustering results with and without dimensionality reduction to better understand the structure of crypto asset markets.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Optimal k value detection using the Elbow Method
- 🧪 K-Means clustering on scaled original features
- ⚙️ Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- 🔍 Visual comparison of clusters before and after PCA
- 📊 Interactive visualizations with `hvPlot`

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & Scikit-learn
- PCA
- KMeans Clustering
- hvPlot
